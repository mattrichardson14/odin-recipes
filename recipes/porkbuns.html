        <li>Yeast Activation: Place yeast, sugar and water in a small bowl. Mix, then set aside for 10 minutes until it becomes foamy.</li>
        <li>Add yeast mixture, oil and water. Mix on low speed for 3 minutes until a smooth ball of dough forms. It should be soft and elastic, not so sticky it gets stuck all over your hands. Adjust with a touch of flour/water if required to get the dough consistency right.</li>
        <li>Cover with cling wrap and place in a warm dry place for 2 hours until it doubles in volume.<i>Meanwhile, make Filling.</i></li>
        <li>Remove cling wrap, scatter over baking powder. Return to stand mixer and mix on low for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto work surface, sprinkle with flour. Knead lightly to form a smooth round disc.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Making buns</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut dough into 4 pieces. Take one piece, roll into an even log, cut into 3 pieces (so 12 pieces in total).</li>
        <li>Take one piece of dough, cover remaining with cling wrap or tea towel.</li>
        <li>Roll into round 4.5" / 11 cm in diameter, making the edges thinner.</li>
        <li>Place dough in hand, put 1 1/2 tbsp of Filling in the centre.</li>
        <li>Pinch 8 pleats around the edges. Then gather the pleats together one by one to seal the bun. Pinch the top the twist.</li>
        <li>Repeat with remaining dough - make 12 in total.</li>
        <li>Cover buns loosely with cling wrap and leave in a warm place for 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Steaming</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a large bamboo steamer (or other steamer) with parchment paper punctured with holes.</li>
        <li>Place 6 to 8 buns on paper, cover with steamer lid.</li>
        <li>Pour about 4 cm / 1 1/2 inches in a wok / pot (steamer should not touch water) and bring to rapid simmer over medium high.</li>
        <li>Place steamer in wok, then cook for 12 minutes. Check water halfway through, top up if required.</li>
        <li>Buns are ready when they spring back when touched, and the buns have formed a smooth skin.</li>
        <li>Remove steamer from wok, serve warm!</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add eschalots and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil and water. Mix.</li>
        <li>While stirring, slowly pour cornflour mixture in. Mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Stir in pork. Cook until sauce is thickened, 1 - 1 1/2 minutes (see video for consistency). Set aside to cool (thickens when cools).</li>
    </ol>
