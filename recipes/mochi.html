    <p>Making homemade mochi ice cream is so much easier than you would think! And a lot more fun than just opting to toss a package of Trader Joe’s mochi ice cream into your shopping cart. </p>
    <p>This mochi ice cream recipe takes just a few minutes to make and is amazingly customizable! I’m using vanilla ice cream, but the sky is the limit here!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups (8oz/225g) vanilla ice cream</li>
        <li>1 cup rice flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>A few drops of red food coloring <i>(optional)</i></li>
        <li>Cornstarch for dusting <i>(or potato starch)</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a small tray with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>With a small ice cream scoop, scoop out twelve scoops of ice cream (about .75oz) onto the paper and place in freezer.</li>
        <li>In a large mircowave-safe bowl, combine the rice flour, sugar, and water. Cover and mircowave for one minute.</li>
        <li>Stir the rice flour mixture with a whisk to remove any lumps, re-cover with the plastic wrap, and microwave for another minute.</li>
        <li>Dip a rubber spatula in water and stir the rice mixture again (do not use the whisk this time - it will be too sticky).</li>
        <li>Cover the rice mixture one more time and microwave for another 30 seconds. It will now be a sticky dough. If adding in food dye stir it in at this point until it's evenly throughout the dough.</li>
        <li>Place a large parchment paper on your counter and cover the paper with a generous dusting of cornstarch (or potato starch).</li>
        <li>With a wet spatula, scrape the dough onto the cornstarch and dust the top of the dough with more cornstarch.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough into a rectangle no less than 1/4 inch thick (about 12x14inches/30x35cm). Keep dusting the top and bottom of the dough with cornstarch as you roll or it will stick.</li>
        <li>Once the dough is rolled out, place the parchment paper on a cookie sheet and place in the refrigerator to set for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has set, cut circles of dough with a 3 ¾ inch (9½ cm) cutter.</li>
        <li>Pick up one circle of dough and brush off the excess cornstarch from both sides.</li>
        <li>Working quickly, take one scoop of ice cream, place in the center of the circle flat side facing you. Press the edges of the dough together around the ice cream ball, squeezing to seal.</li>
        <li>Wrap the mochi ice cream balls in cling wrap and place seam side down back in the freezer to set. You could use an egg carton to keep them upright. Repeat with remaining circles of dough and ice cream balls. Allow mochi to freeze totally for a minimum of 2 hours in the freezer.</li>
        <li>When ready to eat, remove from the freezer and let sit for a few minutes to let soften.</li>
        <li>Store in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 1 week.</li>
    </ol>
